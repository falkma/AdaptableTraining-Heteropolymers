## Adaptable sets of heteropolymer interactions

The code uploaded here is for replicating the heteropolymer simulation results of Falk et al., "Learning to learn by using nonequilibrium training protocols for adaptable materials". All code is run in Python and HOOMD-blue.

The scripts in this repository implement a combined optimization and simulation procedure for heteropolymer folding; please find more detail in the Methods section of the paper.
